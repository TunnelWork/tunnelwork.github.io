Welcome back! Tunnel.Work has been hibernating for years and recently we are trying to wake up. With so many things changed, it's time for us to change as well. 

We are presenting you...

## Anti-Censorship: Circumvention-as-a-Service (CaaS)
Still miss our various node packages? We have good news for you. Starting this year we will be providing a new solution named **Circumvention-as-a-Service (CaaS)**.

**CaaS** isn't any specific technology, but an evolving combination of all practical censorship circumventions.

### Good ol' stuffs
**CaaS** supports multiple well-known protocols, which greatly extend the usability on multiple platforms including the ones that is less open-source friendly. We have plans to support: 

- Shadowsocks
- Trojan
- Vmess
- WireGuard

**Subscription** will also be supported for Shadowsocks, Trojan, and Vmess protocol.

### New Technology
**CaaS** also includes latest circumvention technology created by researchers all over the world. We have plans to support: 

- [Conjure](https://github.com/refraction-networking/conjure)
- [Geneva](https://github.com/kkevsterrr/geneva)
- [utls](https://github.com/refraction-networking/utls) based TLS Fingerprint mimicking

### Timeline

The development of **CaaS** is still in progress but we can't wait to share you the great news that the _Alpha_ test build of **CaaS** will be released in August 2022, which grants access to **invited users** only. And an **application-based** _Beta_ test will be available by the end of year 2022.
